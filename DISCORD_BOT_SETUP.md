3. Go to the "Bot" section in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add Bot"
5. Under "Token", click "Copy" to get your bot token
6. Save this token securely - you'll need it later

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
1. Check if the bot is online in your Discord server
2. Verify the bot has the correct permissions
3. Ensure the bot token is correct

### OpenAI Errors
1. Check your OpenAI API key is valid
2. Ensure you have sufficient API credits
3. The bot will use fallback responses if OpenAI is unavailable

### Permission Errors
1. Make sure the bot has "Send Messages" permission
2. Check that "Message Content Intent" is enabled
3. Verify the bot is in the correct channel

## Integration with Akorn Web App

The Discord bot works alongside the web-based mascot AI. Both use the same AI logic and school-specific personalities, providing a consistent experience across platforms.

## Security Notes

- Never share your bot token publicly
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor bot usage and API costs
